# Spotify-clone
This is my first mini project using HTML and CSS. It’s a simple clone of the Spotify music player interface, designed to practice front-end web development skills. The project includes a navbar, playlist section, album art, and a music control panel, styled to look like the real Spotify UI. It focuses on layout design and basic styling
